            <h3>Internet And Technology</h3><br>
            <marquee behavior="" direction="">The only constant in the technology industry is change.</marquee> <br> <br>
            <p>Internet Technologies is a technical field that covers the skills required to develop application forms on the Internet or Internet-based systems utilizing e-commerce, cloud, mobile, and Web technologies.</p>
            <img src="img/IT.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Impact of Internet in our daily</h3><br>
            <p style="background-color:#ecfdf8 ;">The Internet provides new avenues for citizens to communicate, congregate, and share social information. The Internet has clearly changed and will continue to change the way we live." These words became a prophecy, as it is difficult to find anyone in a developed country who has never used the Internet for any purpose. The Internet serves several functions: it educates, entertains, and informs. Students, for example, can find additional information for any course, while parents can find professional advice on childcare. Furthermore, the Internet is the world's largest information archive. It contains information on organizations, services, laws, employment, and so on. The internet has its own set of advantages and disadvantages; it can be extremely beneficial to us while also being used to destroy or harm others. The internet has given rise to cybercrime, with teenagers and young people being the most common victims. We all hear about these cases in our daily lives, such as leaking someone's private clips or pictures on the internet for the sake of jealousy, retaliation, or hacking. However, the Internet is not inherently bad because it provides us with global access. With the internet, one can see and communicate with people from all over the world. Also, we have access to many things that make our lives so much easier, such as ordering food or groceries, shopping, chatting, and sending emails, which were not possible without the internet. The internet has become our lifeline, and it is difficult to imagine our lives without it.</p>
            <h3>Impact of smart phone</h3><br>
            <p style="background-color:#ecfdf8 ;">Cell phones are important to most people. Cell phones have a daily impact on their lives. Almost everyone owns a mobile phone. Cell phones are also influencing every aspect of people's lives, from communication to online information access. People are so addicted to their cell phones that it is the last thing they see before going to bed. Furthermore, most people sleep with their cell phones nearby, and there is a high possibility that cell phones will negatively affect them. People are so reliant on their cellphones that they can't function without them. Furthermore, people are so careless that they use their phones while they are charging. The phones have a high risk of overheating and exploding. Another reason cell phones have negative effects is that people use them while driving, which has resulted in numerous accidents and the deaths of many people. Everyone knows that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but people continue to do it. We should reduce the use of cellphones although it is essential for our daily basis.</p>
